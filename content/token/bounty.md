**March 2021 updates:**
#### Residential IP bounty
* Maximum earnings of 150 MYST / Mysterium Node 
* 400 nodes will earn in total
* New region introduced: Canada 
#### Global IP bounty
* Maximum earnings of 40 MYST / Mysterium Node
* 4 nodes / region in Global IP bounty 

Being a part of the Mysterium Network Node Pilot means you join us in the research phase of our project. So expect rapid
changes to bounty rules.

**Updates 24/02/2021:**

As we progress to mainnet, we are adding flexibility to our residential IP bounty program. This begins with an introduction of a cap of bounty rewards to 60,000 MYST/ month for the residential IP bounty program. We are also introducing a cap of 160 MYST/ country for each upcoming month. 

Expect quick and iterative changes to the bounty program. Monthly changes to regions and the total amount top performing nodes will get paid will be introduced. Watch this space and our discord channels for updates. 

Here are the two current bounties running within the Mysterium Node Pilot:

1. [Residential IP bounties with payout caps and rolling payments + New countries üá¶üá∫üá≥üá±](#residential-ip-bounties-with-payout-caps-and-rolling-payments)
2. [Top 3 nodes / region bounties üåç](#top-3-node--region-global-bounty)

Important Definitions:

**MYSTT** - Test tokens used to calculate the usage of your node. 1 MYSTT = 1
MYST. [See how much MYST costs today](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mysterium).

**Residential IP** - An IP address tied to a physical device, in our case Raspberry
Pis [preferred for Mysterium Network and a higher likelihood of earning], desktops or mobile phones.

### Residential IP bounties with payout caps and rolling payments

Our first node pilot bounty rule will only apply to **residential IPs in the following regions:** 
- United Kingdom
- United States
- Italy
- India
- Germany
- Australia
- Netherlands

**You will earn by data transmitted through your node and session time**. As your node transmits data, you will begin to
earn MYSTT.

MYSTT functions like points. Earnings will be calculated by the amount of MYSTT accumulated by your node at the end of
the month.

We will be capping the number of nodes paid out per target region. In each of these regions, if you are running a
residential IP you can earn **up to 250 MYST**.<sup>*</sup>

MYSTT will be calculated such that 1 MYSTT = 1 MYST. **If you do not earn enough MYSTT in the first month to get a
payout, your accumulated MYSTT will be transferred to the next month.**<sup>**</sup> This means that you will stand a higher chance
of being one of the top nodes in your region in month two. Once you get paid, your MYSTT value will go back to zero for
the following month.

**We will have a total cap of 250 nodes paid out for the following regions: the UK, US, Italy, India, Germany, Australia,
Netherlands.**

When it comes to residential IPs, we may add more countries or change limits. We will provide you with 1-week notice in
the case of upcoming changes. Regions are chosen based on the interest expressed by network users.

**For example** - _John has been running a node in the UK for the past 2 months. At the beginning of the month of March,
the number of MYSTT accumulated in his account will be zero. Over the course of the month, John will offer a VPN service
from his node to end-users and to whitelisted traffic within the network. This will start to earn him MYSTT. At the end
of March, John earns a total of 100 MYSTT._

_Scenario A: If John is among the top 100 nodes [calculated by the total amount of MYSTT earned], he will be eligible
for the bounty. He will collect his payout in MYST and start month two with zero MYSTT._

_Scenario B: If John does not earn enough MYSTT to be one of the top 100 in the UK, his 100 MYSTT will roll over to
month two. Let's say John earns another 120 MYSTT in month two. This brings him to a total of 220 MYSTT accumulated over
the two months. In month two John is within the top 100 nodes in the UK based on his total of 300 MYSTT._ **_He will be
able to collect 250 MYST_** _as his payout for the month. Once he collects his payout, his MYSTT balance will fall to
zero on month three._

**To reiterate: MYSTT will be calculated such that 1 MYSTT = 1 MYST. Each payout will be capped at 250 MYST / node.**

Payouts happen at the beginning of each month.<sup>***</sup>

### Top 3 node / region global bounty

Our second node pilot bounty rule will apply to **all types of IPs in all regions of the world.**

**Mysterium Node Global Bounty is open to every country in the world.** With this bounty, nodes with any type of IP are
eligible to earn [Residential IP, Data Centre IP, etc]. To be eligible you must have an identifiable IP address and
verification of your geolocation checked against [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home).

For this bounty, we will only pay the top 3 performing nodes per region. Top 3 node earnings are capped at 70 MYST. If
you are already participating in our "Residential IP bounties with payout caps and rolling payments" this is a way for
you to earn an extra 70 MYST.

How will this be calculated? Once you connect your node you will begin earning MYSTT in exchange for data usage. MYSTT
functions like points. The three nodes with the highest number of MYSTT will earn for the month. **If you earn MYSTT but
do not qualify as one of the top three, do not fear - you will be able to keep your MYSTT and continue to accumulate
them in the following month**, which puts you in a better position to clinch the top 3 node position for your region in
the upcoming months.

**For example** - _Jane begins running a node in Turkey. In month one she accumulates 80 MYSTT. This does not place her
within the top 3 nodes within her region. She continues to run her node in month two. During this period she earns
another 90 MYSTT. The total number of MYSTT in her balance is 170 at the end of month two. She is now one of the top
three nodes for month two based on her total amount of MYSTT accumulated. This makes her eligible for a 70 MYST bounty
payout. Once she chooses to get the bounty payout, her MYSTT balance will fall to zero and she will have to begin
accumulating MYSTT starting from zero at month 3._

Payouts happen at the beginning of each month.<sup>***</sup>

\* This cap is due to change as the market reacts to our move to MainNet

** Network fork means all MYSTT collected to date will disappear as you upgrade your node. This will mean you will start
with a balance of zero.

*** Due to Ethereum transaction fees we will be increasing our minimum payout value to $3 USD. This will go into effect
in September and will affect payouts moving forward. Don't worry if you haven't hit the $3 USD threshold, your earnings
will roll over to the next month and continue to accumulate until you hit our minimum limit for a payout.  
Payouts will be executed by the 7th on each month in the upcoming months as we will be limiting gas fee we're paying to
miners, to reduce the transactions fees for the blockchain.

**If you abuse the Mysterium Node Pilot bounty rules, you will not be paid.**

We are extremely conscious of building a resilient and robust network. This means keeping an eye out for bad actors. We
see the following criteria as abuse:

1. Multiple nodes running on the same subnet
2. Artificially producing large amounts of traffic/sessions for your node. Traffic should be natural, produced by 3rd
   parties, Mysterium Network‚Äôs super proxy or test agent.

This list of abuse criteria will grow - we know hackers out there will continue to game the system. We‚Äôre a hacktivist
team, so we expect it, but don‚Äôt expect to get paid ü§£ü§£ü§£
